Project: HabitTrackr â€“ Mobile Habit Tracker

Stack: React Native (Expo), TypeScript, React Navigation, Supabase (backend, added later)

Key Rules:
Purpose:
Build a clean, mobile-first, production-grade habit tracking app for iOS/Android using React Native with Expo.

Architecture:

Screens in /src/screens

Components in /src/components

Service logic (API/Supabase) in /src/services

All code in TypeScript

Navigation:

Use React Navigation (native stack).

All main flows should have clear navigation.

UI/UX:

Minimal, modern mobile design.

All layouts must be mobile-responsive and touch-friendly.

Add placeholder/mock data for habits, check-ins, users during initial development.

Data:

Use in-memory/mock data for all habit and check-in logic until backend is wired up.

No direct API/network calls until backend milestone.

Development Style:

Prefer functional components with hooks.

Code must be clean, modular, and easy to test.

Add comments where logic is non-trivial.

Security:

No secrets or API keys in source files; use environment variables.

Testing:


Prioritize feature completeness and screen flow before backend wiring.
